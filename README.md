# Secure and Scalable Network Infrastructure for a Modern Hotel  

This project explains the design and implementation of a secure and scalable network infrastructure for a modern hotel. By leveraging Cisco Packet Tracer, we have topologically designed, configured, and tested the network to ensure functionality and efficiency.  

## Key Features  
1. **Hierarchical Architecture**:  
   - Designed with a layered structure for scalability and manageability.  
2. **VLAN Segmentation**:  
   - Isolates traffic between departments across three floors to enhance security.  
3. **OSPF Routing**:  
   - Manages inter-departmental communication efficiently.  
4. **Dynamic IP Allocation**:  
   - DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses for wired and wireless devices.  
5. **Secure Remote Access**:  
   - SSH ensures encrypted communication for remote management.
